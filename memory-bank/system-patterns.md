# System Patterns: Thai Tokenizer

## Architecture Overview

_Note: Architecture to be defined during implementation phase_

## Planned System Design

Based on typical tokenizer architectures, we anticipate:

### Core Components

```
ThaiTokenizer/
├── tokenizer/
│   ├── core.py          # Main tokenizer class
│   ├── algorithms/      # Different tokenization strategies
│   ├── preprocessing/   # Text cleaning and normalization
│   └── postprocessing/  # Token refinement and formatting
├── models/             # Language models or dictionaries
├── utils/              # Helper functions
└── tests/              # Test suite
```

## Design Patterns (Planned)

### Strategy Pattern

- Multiple tokenization algorithms (rule-based, dictionary-based, ML-based)
- Allow runtime switching between strategies
- Easy to add new tokenization methods

### Factory Pattern

- Create tokenizer instances with different configurations
- Handle different tokenization modes (word, syllable, character)

### Pipeline Pattern

- Preprocessing → Tokenization → Postprocessing
- Modular stages for text transformation

## Key Technical Decisions (To Be Made)

### Tokenization Approaches

1. **Rule-based**: Pattern matching and linguistic rules
2. **Dictionary-based**: Maximum matching with word dictionaries
3. **Machine Learning**: Neural networks or statistical models
4. **Hybrid**: Combination of multiple approaches

### Performance Considerations

- Memory usage for large texts
- Processing speed optimization
- Caching strategies for repeated tokenization
- Batch processing capabilities

### Error Handling

- Graceful handling of malformed input
- Fallback strategies for unknown text patterns
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Integration Patterns

### External Libraries

- Consider integration with existing Thai NLP tools
- Compatibility with popular frameworks (spaCy, NLTK)
- Standard interfaces for tokenizer plugins

### API Design

- Clean, intuitive interface
- Configurable parameters
- Consistent return formats
- Error handling and validation

## Quality Patterns

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for full pipeline
- Performance benchmarks
- Accuracy evaluation against gold standard datasets

### Documentation

- Code documentation with docstrings
- User guides and examples
- API reference
- Contributing guidelines

_Note: This document will be updated as architecture decisions are made and implementation progresses._
