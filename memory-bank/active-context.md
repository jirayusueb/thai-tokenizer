# Active Context: Thai Tokenizer

## Current Work Focus

**MLX LoRA Implementation Phase** - Building a Thai tokenizer using MLX framework with LoRA fine-tuning of Qwen3-4B.

## Immediate Tasks

1. **Memory Bank Setup** ✅ (Completed)

   - Updated with MLX LoRA requirements
   - Captured new technical approach and constraints

2. **MLX LoRA Implementation** ✅ (Completed)
   - Set up main.ipynb with complete pipeline
   - Implemented preprocessing for Thai wiki dataset
   - Configured Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 with LoRA adapters
   - Created training and inference workflows
   - Built comprehensive testing and evaluation framework

## Recent Changes

- Created basic Python project structure with pyproject.toml
- Established minimal project dependencies
- Created main.ipynb for development and experimentation

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made

- **Approach**: MLX LoRA fine-tuning of Qwen3-4B transformer model
- **Dataset**: Thai Wikipedia dataset v3 (https://huggingface.co/datasets/pythainlp/thai-wiki-dataset-v3)
- **Framework**: MLX for Apple Silicon optimization
- **Implementation**: Single Jupyter notebook (main.ipynb) with complete pipeline

### Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Base Model**: Qwen3-4B for strong multilingual capabilities
2. **Fine-tuning Method**: LoRA for efficient parameter adaptation
3. **Pipeline Structure**: Preprocessing → Training → Inference
4. **Optimization**: MLX framework for Apple Silicon performance

## Current Blockers

- None identified yet - project is in early planning phase

## Working Notes

- Project structure is minimal - room for significant development
- Need to research existing Thai tokenization solutions
- Consider creating benchmarks for evaluation
- Think about API design early to guide implementation

## Context for Next Session

- Memory bank initialized and documented
- Ready to begin technical analysis and implementation planning
- Project vision established, now need to move to concrete development steps
